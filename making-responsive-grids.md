          We’ll be using two different CSS files now: one for the grid and one for our other CSS.

          This helps us keep our CSS organized and separated. Instead of one massively long CSS file, we can separate them into different, singularly purposed files.

  - title: "Basic grid CSS"
    before: |
      Inside the `grid.css` file we add the CSS for the grid specifically—nothing else.

      *In this example we’re going to write our own `flexbox`-based grid, like [Gridifier](https://gridifier.web-dev.tools/), much much simpler.*
    code_lang: "css"
    code_file: "css/grid.css"
    code: |
      .grid {
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
      }

      - num: 2
        text: "Turn the `.grid` into a flex container, so that all it’s immediate children arrange in a row."
      - num: 3
        text: "We’ll also allow the flex items to wrap to allow us to make responsive layouts a little more easily."

  - title: "Size classes for extra small screens"
    before: |
      Now that we have the basics done we need to add more classes to each of the `.unit` tags for different sizes.

      We’ll start with the extra small size, so the class will start with `xs-`. Then every unit should take up the full width, so in fractions that’s just `1`. So our final class is going to be `xs-1`.

          Add a second class to unit, the `.xs-1` class. Each class is separated by a space.

          So, the `.unit` now has these two classes:

          - `.unit`
          - `.xs-1`

  - title: "Add the CSS for the extra small size"
    before: |
      Now that we have the names of the classes we can target the extra small size in our `grid.css` file.

      This class should be **above all media queries** because it is the smallest size we’re designing for.
    code_lang: "css"
    code_file: "css/grid.css"
    code: |
      ⋮
      .grid {
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
      }

      .xs-1 {
        width: 100%;
      }
    lines:
      - num: "2-5"
        fade: true
      - num: "7-9"
        text: "Because the fraction is `1` the width will then be `100%`"
    after: |
      Now we should see something that looks like this (which isn’t too terribly different from where we started.)

      ![](xs.jpg)

  - title: "Size classes for small screens"
    before: |
      Next up we’ll move to another screen size: small screens, using classes that start with `s-`

      The small screen layout is essentially the same: each `.unit` taking up the whole width.

      *The great thing about having all these different classes is that now we can look at our HTML and know exactly what each element is doing on each different screen size.*

          Add a fourth class to unit, the `.m-` classes. So, the `.unit` now has these four classes:

      We’re mixing the layout up a little bit at medium sizes:

      1. The first `.unit` is still taking the full width, with a class of `.m-1`
      2. The second and third units are now taking up ½ of the space, with the `.m-1-2` class.

  - title: "Add the CSS for the medium size"
    before: |
      Since we’re working in a larger screen size, that means a new media query: `38em`.

    code: |

      @media only screen and (min-width: 38em) {

        .m-1 {
          width: 100%;

    after: |
      Adjusting your screen width, we should see this as the layout:

      ![](m.jpg)

      *If you resize the screen bigger and smaller it should switch between the two different layouts we have now.*

  - title: "Finally: the large screens"
    before: |
      This one is up to you! The goal is to make the large screen into 3 columns, like this:

      ![](l.jpg)

      **Steps to complete:**

      1. Add classes to each `.unit` representing their sizes on large screens
      2. In `grid.css`, add a new media query for `60em`
      3. Add the necessary classes inside that media query to give the units the correct sizes

      **I didn’t want to have to go through the process of creating a grid every time, so I made myself a tool to generate grids: [Gridifier](https://gridifier.web-dev.tools/). This is what we’ll look at in the next lesson.**
