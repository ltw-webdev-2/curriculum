    Typografier is a tool I created for myself that generates a responsive type system. It was inspired by lots of other type systems like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and [Type Scale](http://type-scale.com/) but has it’s own features and doesn’t require you to use the whole framework to implement it in your websites.

    Let’s look at how to use Typografier in your website.

steps:
  - title: "Set up the project"
    before: |
      Before we get started, create some files and get ready.
    folders:
      - label: "using-a-type-system"
        type: folder
      - label: "index.html"
        indent: 1
      - label: "css"
        type: folder
        indent: 1
      - label: "type.css"
        indent: 2
      - label: "main.css"
        indent: 2
      - label: "images"
        type: folder
        indent: 1
        fade: true
      - label: "glyptodon.jpg"
        indent: 2
        fade: true
    after: |
      1. Make an `index.html`
      2. Make a `type.css` in your `css` folder
      3. Make a `main.css` in your `css` folder

          It makes more semantic sense to use a `<small>` tag here because it’s a copyright-like notice. I’m using a `<p>` tag simply because I want to demonstrate a point about margins & font-sizes.

      We should see something like this when we refresh in the browser.

  - title: "Add the Typografier CSS"
    before: |
      We’re going to use Typografier to generate a fully complete type system for us to use in our website.

      ### [Go to Typografier.](https://typografier.web-dev.tools/)

      *Keep all the settings as their defaults.*

      ![](typografier.jpg)

      Copy all code generated by Typografier, in the right-hand panel & paste it into your `type.css` file.

      *That’s it—we have a fully functional type system. Now we can concentrate fully on our layout and write much less CSS.*

      **We should never touch the generated CSS just in case we want to replace it later.**
    after: |
      Refresh to see what Typografier has done to the type. Try resizing your browser and notice how the font-sizes and line-heights adjust.

      ![](type-css.png)

  - title: "Add spacing classes"
    before: |
      Let’s start by making the space around things consistent.

      The spacing classes add padding and margins that match the type size and line-height. This allows us to create a consistent vertical rhythm because all space around and inside elements matches the type sizes.

      **It’s important to remember that Typografier removes all top margins and uses only the bottom margins—this makes it much easier to keep a consistent vertical rhythm.**

        fade: true
      - num: 6
        text: |
          The `.island` class adds padding, equal to the `line-height` around all four sides.

          We’re using `.island` here to add space around the text but still allow the image to be full bleed.
      - num: 11
        text: |
          The `.push-0` class will remove the default `margin` from the bottom of an element.

          We’re using it here because if we didn’t remove the bottom margin, there would be extra space at the bottom caused by the margin of the `<p>` adding onto the padding of `.island`
    after: |
      So, our layout should look like this now:

      ![](spacing.png)

  - title: "Add font sizes"
    before: |
      Now, let’s add a few classes to adjust the font size on some elements, to make them bigger and smaller.

      Typografier’s font-size classes are based on the metric system, or computer sizes if that’s more familiar. `.micro` is the smallest, going up to `.kilo`, `.giga`, and all the way to `.yotta`

      *There are only 10 font-sizes to choose from—if you need more than that you’re probably doing something wrong.*

  - title: "Add stylistic classes"
    before: |
      Typografier has a few stylistic classes to control font styles and text positions.

      *Be warned though, many of these stylistic classes aren’t responsive: if you make something `bold` it’s always bold.*

    after: |
      That’s it we’re done.

      With Typografier we were able to make a nice layout, with spacing consistency and good vertical rhythm without touching CSS (except to add some colours).
